I developed an insightful Netflix dashboard using Tableau, based on a dataset containing over 6,000 records and 12 distinct fields related to movies and TV shows. This project demonstrates the powerful role of data visualization in the entertainment industry. Here's an overview of the key elements:

### Key Features:

📅 Time-Based Visualization: Displayed the distribution of TV shows and movies based on their release dates, offering a clear temporal perspective.

🌍 Global Movie Map: Built an interactive world map that highlights the number of movies released per country, providing a global overview.

📈 Content Type Breakdown: Designed a detailed chart to represent the percentage and count of TV shows vs. movies, giving insights into the content types.

🔍 Interactive Filters: Added filters to enable users to explore individual details like descriptions, duration, and ratings of specific movies and TV shows.

🎨 Sleek Dashboard Layout: Carefully styled the dashboard to ensure a professional and polished visual presentation.

🔴 Netflix Branding: Integrated the iconic Netflix logo for a more authentic and recognizable design.

### Conclusion:

This project highlights my expertise in Tableau by transforming raw data into a visually engaging and meaningful dashboard. It's a perfect example of blending analytics with creative design to tell a compelling story through data! 🌟📺
